# Install Current Version
Use the following guide to download Suricata in a lxc container.

Container Template: Ubuntu 22.04

Guide: https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/quickstart.html

# Install Previous Version 
Use the following guide to download Suricata in a lxc container with a small mod to the version command.

Container Template: Ubuntu 22.04

Guide: https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/quickstart.html

The command given in step "2.1. Installation" will install the current stable version. To install a specific version, the second line of the command has to be modified. For example, to install Suricata ver. 7.0.11 you would use the command below. 

```
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-7.0
sudo apt update
sudo apt install suricata jq
```

What changed?

The end of the second line changed from "suricata-stable" to "suricata-7.0". To install Suricata ver. 6 and so on, all you need to do is changed the number to the desired version.
