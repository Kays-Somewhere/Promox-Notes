# Troubleshooting 
#### In the Shell- "E: Failed to fetch https://enterprise.proxmox.com/xxx/xxx ..."
- Enterprise repos are still enabled on the Node. Disabling them will remove this error. An easy and safe way to do this is to run a post install script from Proxmox Helper Scripts (support to the project!). The script can be found at:
    - https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=post-pve-install
 
#### When trying to Connnect to the Web UI- "The connection has timed out"
- Check if Tailscales is running and has an active connection on the computer that is conneting to the Web UI
- Check the IP address that you are trying to connect to, does it look like 100.xx.xx.xx:8006? Is it the correct IP?
- Check your Tailscale's account, is the host showing connected to Tailscale?
